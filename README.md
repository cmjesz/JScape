# JScape

A nostalgic project to create a working web browser to look like Netscape.

Still in its infancy but working. Currently I have not done much in terms of functionality. Web browsing works as well as 
navigating forward/backward. One interesting thing that happened while working on this is that after navigating back 
and entering a new URL to view, the forward pages are preserved. I decided it was an interesting feature so I left it as 
is for now, though I plan to add in settings to allow you to enable/disable this as well as do other things.
